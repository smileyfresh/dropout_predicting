# Predicting Dropouts
## Capstone 3 Proposal


### Overview

This project will use machine learning techniques to build a model that will predict whether a student is likely to dropout at the high school level.

### Data Source

Data will be sourced from the Harvard Strategic Data Project's [OpenSDP](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/opensdp). Specifically, I will be utilizing the following [data](https://github.com/OpenSDP/predicting_dropouts/tree/master/data) and [guides](https://hwpi.harvard.edu/files/sdp/files/sdp-toolkit-cg-data-linking-guide.pdf) from the SDP toolkit.
