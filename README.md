# Sealing the Cracks

### Overview

This project uses machine learning techniques to build a model that will predict whether a student is likely to dropout at the high school level. I want to explore ways to predict early whether a student will struggle at the high school level, and by determining the features that contribute to those struggles better address them so that students can have more positive educational experiences and have more fulfilling lives. <img style="float: right;" src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LoqwiY4U-_rc-ZzDGK-671Mx77Cc5MPv/view">

### Data Source

Data will be sourced from the Harvard Strategic Data Project's [OpenSDP](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/opensdp). Specifically, I will be utilizing the following [data](https://github.com/OpenSDP/predicting_dropouts/tree/master/data) and [guides](https://hwpi.harvard.edu/files/sdp/files/sdp-toolkit-cg-data-linking-guide.pdf) from the SDP toolkit.

### Approach

After initial exploratory data analysis, I will determine the most relevant features from the 67 included in the data set. I will then build a binary classification model using either logistic regression or decision tree/random forest to predict the target of dropout/non-dropout. I will then test the accuracy of these models and explore options for tuning.
